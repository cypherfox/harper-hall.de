He rants about the inability of legal discourse against libelous writers and prophecies a dark future where everybody can say what he wants to say.
I completely agree with Mr. Seigenthaler that libelous content anywhere should answer to legal discourse. His further actions document that, while difficult in the maze of participants (the service provider wikipedia, the ISP of the original writer, BellSouth, and the yet unkown original author of the â€˜pedia entry), he can file a suit agains John Doe and persue due course of the law to take the perpetrator to task.</description></item></channel></rss>
