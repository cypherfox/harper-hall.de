# Books of interest

I think that everybody who designs software systems or manages people who in turn design software software system should have read most or all of these books. I have repeatedly experience people ignoring the lessens taught by the authors of these books, sometimes even decades after publications.

The books are in order of original publication, not order of preference. Especially the books (co-)written by Gene Kim make a lot more sense when read in the order of publication.
