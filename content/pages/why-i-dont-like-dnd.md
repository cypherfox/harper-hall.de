# A Caveat

I have started playing pen and paper Roleplaying Games in the summer of 1984 with D&D second edition
(BECMI Version: the red Basic Set). Thus this rule-set will always hold a special place in my heart
as it introduced me to this fantastic hobby.

Later I dabbled a bit in Advanced D&D, tried many other games during the late 1980s, as I was a high
school student and had lots of time. Then I played RoleMaster 2nd Ed. for almost 15 years once per
week. Then I had things like work, family and other hobbies taking up my time, so that I have played
very little for the last 15 years.

About a year ago I have discovered [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/), finding their content
very entertaining. But it brought back my loathing about all the things I dislike about DnD. And over
the years these pain points have grown in number as I learned about historical arms, armor and
combat, since I have grown to be a massive history nerd.

# A second Caveat

I think that Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson have done a remarkable thing in making the paradigm shift
from miniature wargaming rules to roleplaying. I think that the initial seed they created has been
brought forward in leaps and bounds even in the first few years.

Subsequent versions of the rules have improved a lot of things from those dark ages eons past.

But there is so still so much I dislike, that I wanted to collect it in a single place. To serve as
reference place for discussions (as if the last 45 years have no been enough) and to keep me
amused. I hope you are as well. 


# Vancian Magic

To get the big one out of the way right away: The [magic
system](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Vancian_magic_system), whereby casters have to
memorize or prepare spells. Casting the spell will erase the knowledge of it, removing the ability
to cast it, until prepared again. This has been successively loosened with each version of the
rules. With the 5th edition magic users can cast any set of spells per day, chosen from those they
have prepared, unless spell level sums are not exceeded. The prepared spells again are chosen each
day from a set of known spells. 

What feels constructed to me, is the fact that a caster knows about the specifics of a spell ("has
it in their spell-books"), but cannot cast it on a given day, due to some selective memory loss, in
the original rules to the point that the spell was completely gone until re-learned. 

I do understand the need to limit the number of times spells can be cast. The alternative would be a
[never ending stream of lightning bolts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_ekugPKqFw). This is not
good for balance if the the lighting bolts have any effect (as they should) and for the sense of
epic powers that a person [wielding lightning should
evoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03lFuZIYv2I)

There are many other mechanisms in limiting magic use: from using resources with monetary value
(e.g. ground gems), via replenishing powers, i.e. Mana Points as in RoleMaster or in most computer
games, all the way to a exhaustion mechanic as found in the ShadowRun RPGs.
