I have finally taken the time get my thoughts organized and point some points together, about how I think cloud-native systems should be build: [The Three Holy Grails of DevOps]({{< relref "/pages/the-holy-grails-of-dev-ops" >}}).

Practically none of the points I make are new or revolutionary. Quite to the contrary, I am still searching for publications that support the individual corollaries where they are missing today.

Therefore please take this document less as a revelation, and more as a personal manifest. This is how I think cloud-native systems should be designed. How an organization should structure itself around that system, in order to reach high levels of efficiency when continuously developing and maintaining that system. And at the same time attain high degrees of security, resilience and scalability concurrently.
