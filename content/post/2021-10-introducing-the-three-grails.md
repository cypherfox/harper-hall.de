I have finally taken the time get my thoughts organized and point some points together, about how I think cloud-native systems should be build: [The Three Holy Grails of DevOps]({{< relref "/pages/the-holy-grails-of-dev-ops" >}}).

Practically none of the points made are new or revolutionary. Quite to the contrary, I am still searching for publications that support the individual corollaries where they are missing today.

Therefore please take this document less as a revelation, and more as a personal manifest how I think cloud-native systems should be designed and how an organization should structure itself around that system to reach high levels of efficiency in continuously develop and maintain that system. And at the same time attain high degrees of security, resilience and scalability concurrently.
