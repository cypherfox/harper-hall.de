I have been thinking about Wardley Maps. I think they are a great tool
to understand business decisions. They may possibly even help me get
upper management to understand why I think they are going in the wrong
direction. 

But in order to have my own recomendations stand up to scrutiny, I
feel I need to apply the teachings of Simon Wardley at least as
rigourously to the architectural and purchasing decisions I make or
prepare for others.

# The Problem

According to the 


# My Take

* as things become more distant to the actual need of the customer,
  the less of profit center does a task appear, but rather simply a
  cost for providing services or products to the customer.
* seeking the lowest cost possible for each of these services should
  occour without regard for old ways or current parts of the organisation.
