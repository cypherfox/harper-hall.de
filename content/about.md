# The Harper Hall is a place of learning, and of music.

I have been a big fan of the Dragonrider books of Anne McCaffrey for
close to 35 years. Even though I do not play an instrument and know
very little of music theory, I think it a fantastic idea to distribute
knowledge through song and music.

This is my little corner of the Halls of knowledge. Here collect
information and my own thoughts on a number of topic of interes to
me. These include, but are not limited to:

* Building and operating distributed systems in a highly available,
  skalable and secure manner. Everything from the distributed systems
  theory to trends in market adoption of tools and frameworks to make
  this happen. I do Kubernetes, prefer Erlang and Go over Java and
  ECMA-Script. 
  
* Software system automation. Notes to make my life easier.

* Designing, running and playing Table Top Roleplaying Systems
  (TTRGPs). I hate D&D, but love Critical Role.
