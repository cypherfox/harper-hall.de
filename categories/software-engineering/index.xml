Here I skip the machine setup covery by Dr. Duh. The short of it is: you need a machine with a current kernal that is disconnecte from the network.
Below are my choices and changes. This is even more opinionated than his document.
Creating Keys Setup the environment:
$ export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d) $ wget -O $GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg.conf Generate a Pin $ tr -dc '[:upper:]' &amp;lt; /dev/urandom | fold -w 20 | head -n1 Write down the pin and keep in safe place.</description></item><item><title>Books of Interest</title><link>http://example.org/pages/books/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/pages/books/</guid><description>Books of interest Unicorn Project,Gene Kim, 2019

My expectation was the &amp;ldquo;single unified monolith&amp;rdquo; that most team would be migrating back to. The voices saying that cloud offerings, and Kubernetes in particular, are much too complex where getting louder and louder.
At the time I did not write about it, as I had no idea, what form this monolith of serenity would take, or I would come from.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Development Checklist</title><link>http://example.org/post/2006-06-efficient-development-checklist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/post/2006-06-efficient-development-checklist/</guid><description>From a discussion with a few colleagues, I was assured of the impression, that while, allmost everybody in software developments knows three things: a) the process (what process?) in most organisations is broken and b) everybody has heard that other, larger better organisations use modern methods (”Oh, that, yes I read about &amp;lt;fortune 500 company&amp;gt; is doin’ it.”) and nobody is using it themselfs, for various reasons. Myself included.
There are a number of small things that you can introduce piece by piece into your development process and see if they work.</description></item><item><title>Things of Interest</title><link>http://example.org/pages/things-of-interest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/pages/things-of-interest/</guid><description>Things of (my) Interest This is a curated list of links on topics that I am interested in.
